In JavaScript, there are different types of errors, and understanding them can 
help you handle errors more effectively. Here are a few common error types:

Error: The base error type from which other error types are derived. 
You can create custom errors by extending this class.

SyntaxError: Occurs when there's a syntax error in the code, such as a missing 
parenthesis or a misspelled keyword.

TypeError: Occurs when an operation is performed on a value of the wrong type. 
For example, calling a non-existent method on an undefined variable.

RangeError: Occurs when a numeric value is not within the expected range. 
For example, accessing an array index that is out of bounds.

ReferenceError: Occurs when you try to access a variable or function that is 
not defined.

Now, let's discuss some techniques for error handling in JavaScript:

try...catch statement: This statement allows you to catch and handle errors 
within a specific block of code. The code inside the try block is executed, and if an error occurs, it is caught and handled in the corresponding catch block.
throw statement: This statement allows you to throw custom errors at specific
points in your code. You can use it to create your own error messages and customize error handling behavior.
Error object: JavaScript provides an Error object that you can use to create 
custom errors. You can extend the Error object to create specific error types 
with custom properties and behaviors.

Error handling patterns: There are various patterns for error handling, 
such as using callback functions to handle asynchronous errors, using finally 
blocks for cleanup operations, and chaining catch blocks to handle specific 
error types.
