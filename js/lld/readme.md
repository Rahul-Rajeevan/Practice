Vehicle: The base class representing a generic vehicle. It has properties such as type, regNumber (registration number), and color. It also includes getter and setter methods for the type property.

Car, Bike, Truck: These are subclasses of the Vehicle class, representing specific types of vehicles. They inherit from the Vehicle class and define their own constructors, passing the specific vehicle type to the superclass constructor using the super keyword.

Slot: Represents an individual parking spot. It has properties like number, type, and isBooked to keep track of whether the spot is currently booked or available. It also includes getter and setter methods for the isBooked property.

ParkingFloor: Represents an individual floor in the parking lot. It has properties like floornumber and an array of _parkingspots, which contains instances of the Slot class. The constructor initializes the _parkingspots array based on the maxFloor parameter, creating slots for different vehicle types.

ParkingLot: Represents the entire parking lot. It has properties like _floors (an array of ParkingFloor instances) and numberofFloors. The constructor initializes the _floors array based on the number parameter, creating ParkingFloor instances for each floor. It also includes methods like parkVehicle, findSlot, and bookslot. The parkVehicle method finds an available slot for a given vehicle type, books the slot, and generates a ticket. The findSlot method iterates through all the floors and spots to find an available slot matching the vehicle type. The bookslot method updates the availability status of the slot.

Ticket: Represents a parking ticket issued when a vehicle is parked. It includes properties like floorNumber, slotNumber, and issuedAt (a Date object) to store information about the parked vehicle.

Example usage: The code creates a new ParkingLot instance with 3 floors. It then creates a new Bike instance and attempts to park it using the parkVehicle method of the ParkingLot instance. The method finds an available slot for a bike, books the slot, and logs the ticket information.
