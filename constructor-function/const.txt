Prototypes and Prototype Chain:

Each JavaScript object has a prototype, which is an object from which it inherits 
properties and methods.
The prototype of an object can be accessed using the prototype property.
Objects created with the same constructor share the same prototype object.
The prototype chain is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and 
methods from their prototypes.
