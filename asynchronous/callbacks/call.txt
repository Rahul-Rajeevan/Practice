Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that allows multiple tasks 
to be executed concurrently without blocking the execution of the main program. 
JavaScript, being a single-threaded language, relies heavily on asynchronous 
programming to handle time-consuming operations, such as network requests and 
file operations, without freezing the user interface.
